# Group-Loans-Lending-Using-Machine-Learning
Diversification is known to be important to lending, but not much is known about their relative performance in giving loans and whether theyâ€™d default or not, especially when they are in conflict. Using the group loan structure in India, we find that in an economic setting dominated by information asymmetry, heterogeneity in groups leads to better performances in paying the Loan  when compared to homogeneity. Using machine learning techniques like XGBoost and Random Forest, the paper shows that social ties increases the risk of default.
